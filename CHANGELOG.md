### History

This module was originally written by Dan Bornstein in 2012 and published to
`npm`. In 2024, Dan discovered that the original repo had been deleted, so he
took the module as published and turned it back into a repo in his account. His
assumption is that, having been deleted by the corporate entity that originally
funded it, the copyright effectively reverted to him.
